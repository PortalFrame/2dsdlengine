Small SDL 2D Game Framework (C++)
===========

A small C++ 2D framework using SDL2 library.

I started this project in 2011 and the origin purpose is to make an easy-to-use framework for fast game development. 
I will make the code consice simple with minimal use of external libraries.

Currently I have integrated it with MSVC and more support will be given to other common IDEs. If you have any compilation problem please let me know

Library that you will need in order to compile & link(for windows I have already configured them):
* SDL2: https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
* SDL2_image: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
* SDL2_ttf: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/


The current features include:
* Concise code
* 3 stack-based game states 
* Move the player
* Basic collision detection
* Basic UI widgets: button, label


I hope this will help you learn the basic ideas behind game development.
Any support would be highly appreciated :-)
