Small SDL 2D Game Engine (C++)
===========

A skeleton of C++ 2D framework with SDL2 library.
I started this project in 2011 and the origin purpose is to make an easy-to-use framework for fast game development in desktop environment.

I recently moved it to **SDL2** with integration of **xCode**.

The library you need in order to compile & link:
* SDL2: https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
* SDL2_image: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
* SDL2_ttf: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/

The current features include:
* Concise code
* 3 game states 
* Move the player
* Basic collision detection
* Basic UI widgets

My Short Plans:
* MVC architecture
* Player jump
* Lua Integration
* The log system
* XML based configuration file and loading
* Graphic improvement
* Shared pointer

Further Considerations:
* OpenGL integration

I hope this will help you learn the basic ideas behind game development.
Any support would be highly appreciated :-)
