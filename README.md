Small SDL 2D Game Framework (C++)
===========

A small C++ 2D framework using SDL2 library.

I will make the code consice simple with minimal use of external libraries.

Currently supported IDE/platforms:
- Windows MSVC: open by 'build/msvc'
- Linux cmake(also valid for cygwin): 
'cd build'
'cmake ..'
'make'

Libraries that I have used:
* SDL2: https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
* SDL2_image: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
* SDL2_ttf: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/


The current features include:
* Concise code
* 3 stack-based game states 
* Move the player
* Basic collision detection
* Basic UI widgets: button, label


I hope this will help you learn the basic ideas behind game development.
Any support would be highly appreciated :-)
