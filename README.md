Small SDL 2D Game Engine (C++)
===========

A skeleton of C++ 2D framework with SDL2 library.
I started this project in 2011 and the origin purpose is to make an easy-to-use framework for fast game development in desktop environment.

I recently moved it to **SDL2** with integration of **xCode**.

The current progress includesï¼š
* 3 game states 
* Move the player
* Basic collision detection
* Basic UI widgets

My Short Plans:
* MVC architecture
* Player jump
* Remove the namespace that I used before
* Singleton: FPS Counter, game state manager
* Lua Integration
* The log system
* XML based configuration file and loading
* Graphic improvement
* Font support
* Shared pointer

I hope this will help you learn the basic ideas behind game development.
Any support would be highly appreciated :-)
