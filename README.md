Small SDL 2D Game Engine (C++)
===========

A skeleton of small C++ 2D framework with SDL library.
I started this project in 2011 and the origin purpose is to make a framework for fast graphic development in desktop environment.

I recently moved it to SDL2 and integrated with xCode.

The current progress is that it includes 3 game states and you can move and jump the player in the game state
